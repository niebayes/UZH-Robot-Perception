1. Can you relate Structure from Motion to 3D reconstruction? In what they differ? 

2. Can you define disparity in both the simplified and the general case? 

3. Can you provide a mathematical expression of depth as a function of the baseline, the disparity and the focal length? 

4. Can you apply error propagation to derive an expression for depth uncertainty? How can we improve the uncertainty?

5. Can you analyze the effects of a large/small baseline? 

6. What is the closest depth that a stereo camera can measure?

7. Are you able to show mathematically how to compute the intersection of two lines (linearly and non-linearly)?

8. What is the geometric interpretation of the linear and non-linear approaches and what error do they minimize?

9. Are you able to provide a definition of epipole, epipolar line and epipolar plane?

10. Are you able to draw the epipolar lines for two converging cameras, for a forward motion situation, and for a side-moving camera?

11. Are you able to define stereo rectification and to derive mathematically the rectifying homographics?

12. How is the disparity map computed?

13. How can one establish stereo correspondences with subpixel accuracy? 

14. Describe one or more simple ways to reject outliers in stereo correspondences.

15. Is stereo vision the only way of estimating depth information? If not, are you able to list alternative options?
