1. How does automatic scale selection work? 

2. What are the good and the bad properties that a function for automatic scale selection should have or not have? 

3. How can we implement scale invariant detection efficiently? (show that we can do this by resampling the image vs. rescaling the kernel). 

4. What is a feature descriptor? (patch of intensity value vs. histogram of oriented gradients). How do we match descriptors? 

5. How is the keypoint detection done in SIFT and how does this differ from Harris? 

6. How does SIFT achieve orientation invariance? 

7. How is the SIFT descriptor built? 

8. What is the repeatability of the SIFT detector after a rescaling of 2? And for a 50 degrees viewpoint change? 

9. Illustrate the 1st and 2nd close ratio of SIFT detection: what's the intuitive reasoning behind it? Where does the 0.8 factor come from?
